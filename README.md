Using Xcode Organizer
When your iOS app crashes, you can use Xcode's Organizer to view the crash logs. Here are the steps to access and use the crash logs in Xcode's Organizer:

Connect your device to your Mac and open Xcode.
Click on the "Window" menu and select "Organizer."
In the Organizer window, select the "Crashes" tab.
You will see a list of crash logs for your app. Click on the one you want to view.
The crash log will appear in the right-hand pane. You can view the details of the crash, including the stack trace and any relevant information about the device or environment at the time of the crash.
You can also symbolicate the crash log to see the function names and file locations of the code that caused the crash. To do this, click the "Download dSYMs" button if it appears, and then click "Re-Symbolicate Log."
Once you have viewed the crash log, you can use the information to diagnose and fix the issue in your app's code.
